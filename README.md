# Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores
###### Every year, school test results impact the college admissions fate of millions of students. In this project, I used standardized test performance data from NYC's public schools to identify the schools with top math results, looked at how performance varied by borough, and found the city's top ten performing schools!
## Insights
###### 1. Which NYC schools have the best math results?
###### *The best math results are at least 80% of the *maximum possible score of 800* for math.*
###### 2. What are the top 10 performing schools based on the combined SAT scores?
###### 3. Which single borough has the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT score?
